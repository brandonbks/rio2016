## Rio 2016 Data Analysis - ISyE 2028 Project

Using the Rio 2016 dataset from Kaggle, our team analyzed data of the athletes' physical data (height/weight/age) and the medals won. We will conduct hypothesis testing to answer the following questions, and use visualizations to support our data analysis.
1. Is the mean height/weight distribution equal across aquatics, gymnastics, and weightlifting. If not, which sports have different means?

      Visualization: Box plot/Density plot

      Testing: ANOVA/LCD

2. Is there a relationship between GDP per capita of a country to the number of medals won by a country?

      Visualization: Scatter plot

      Testing: Linear Regression

3. Is there a difference in the mean age of male/female athletes of those who won in gymnastic events?

      Visualization: Density plot

      Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for mean difference

4. Is there a difference in the mean height between males/females, and is there a difference in the variability of mean height between males/females?

      Visualization: Matrix scatter plot/Density plot

      Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for mean difference and variance

      Further analysis: Machine learning techniques with SVMs

5. Is there a difference in the variability in age for those who compete in equestrian and gymnastics?

      Visualization: Box plot/Density plot

      Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for variance

6. Is the proportion of the number of females winning at least one medal equal to the proportion of males winning at least one medal?

      Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for proportion
