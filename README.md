## Rio 2016 Data Analysis - ISyE 2028 Project

Using the Rio 2016 dataset from Kaggle, our team analyzed data of the athletes' physical data (height/weight/age) and the medals won. We will conduct hypothesis testing to answer the following questions, and use visualizations to support our data analysis.
1. Is the mean height/weight distribution (i.e BMI) equal across aquatics, gymnastics, and weightlifting? If not, which sports have different means? 
Visualization: Box plot
Testing: ANOVA/LCD
2. Is there a relationship between GDP per capita of a country to the number of medals won by a country?
Visualization: Scatter plot
Testing: Linear Regression
3. Is there a difference in the mean age of male/female athletes of those who won in gymnastic events?
Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for mean difference
4. Is there a difference in the mean height between males/females, and is there a difference in the variability of mean height between males/females?
Visualization: Scatter plot/Density plot
Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for mean difference and variance
Further analysis: Machine learning techniques with SVMs
5. Is there a relationship between height and the number of medals won (separate between males and females)
Visualization: Scatter plot
Testing: Linear Regression or ANOVA
6. Is there a difference in the variability in age for those who compete in equestrian and gymnastics?
Visualizations: Box plot/Comparative histogram
Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing 
7. Is the proportion of the number of females winning at least one medal equal to the proportion of males winning at least one medal?
Testing: 2 population hypothesis testing for mean difference
